Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

1.First we have to find the number of elements of the array
2.Now find the sum of all elements
3.Now find the sum of natural number by the formula upto size 
4.Now subtract sum of natural number by sum of all elements
5.The result of the subtraction is the missing number
